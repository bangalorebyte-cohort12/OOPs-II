# OOPs-II
Inheritance

Resources:

  - To revisit inheritance, please read chapter 18 of Think Python.
  - The logic gate visuals are in the same powerpoint as used yesterday in OOPs -I.
  - To revisit decorators please look at section 11.3.6 in Core Python. 
  
Exercises: 

1) Complete the LogicGate problem. Ensure that you get the correct response to the following sequences:  
    
    + Two And Gates --> One OR Gate --> Not Gate
    + Four And Gates --> Two OR Gate ---> Two Note Gate --> One OR Gate

2) Create a user database Class with the following columns: login, password, and last login timestamp. (see Example 7.1 in Core Python). Dictionary Example in Core Python) It manages a system requiring users to log in before access to resources is allowed. This database class has two methods, 

- Update (loading any previously saved user information on instantiation and providing accessor functions to add or update database information). 
- Delete user( This database also supports entries to be deleted)
